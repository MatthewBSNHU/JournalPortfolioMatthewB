CS-305 Software Security 8-1 Journal: Portfolio

For this assignment, I operated within the context of Global Rain, a software company specializing in tailored software solutions for entrepreneurs, businesses, and government entities worldwide. Our guiding principle is that "Security is everyone's responsibility." Our task was to aid Artemis Financial in modernizing its operations and implementing the latest in software security measures. Artemis Financial, with its RESTful web application programming interface (API), sought our expertise to fortify its defenses against external threats.

Navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of online security presented its challenges, but I believe I managed adequately. Safeguarding all transactions and communications is critical for any business, particularly for a financial institution tasked with protecting customer/client data, company information, and intellectual property. Given that Artemis Financial's web-based software focuses on financial consulting and the development of personalized financial plans, securing every aspect of communication involving customer accounts, including usernames, passwords, and bank account information, during the assessment process is paramount.

In devising a strategy to secure their system, I examined the foundational elements of the code:

Code Quality: Ensuring code readability and clarity.
Secure Coding: Implementing robust code sanitization techniques such as exception handling and error checks to maintain consistency in the application's business logic.
Cryptography: Employing proper encryption methods to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted information.
Client/Server Communication: Establishing secure channels for financial transactions between clients and the web application's backend server.
API Security: Configuring API connections to prevent security breaches.
To enhance the security and integrity of our code, I advocated for the integration of a dependency-check plugin scanner. This non-intrusive testing method is instrumental in ensuring code security and the currency of dependencies. Updating dependencies is crucial, as outdated dependencies can compromise the application's security.
